                <p style="width: 75%">A while ago I got a huge amount of old Chips, including a Ceramic MC6800 CPU. I wanted to build a Computer around this nice looking Chip and decided to recreate the <a href="http://www.mjbauer.biz/DREAM6800.htm">D.R.E.A.M. 6800</a>, published in the magazine "Electronics Australia" in 1979 and designed by Michael Bauer.</p>

                <p style="width: 75%">The first thing i had to start with was the Circuit Board. After i looked around a bit, i found two Versions:<br>
                The first one was the original layout shown in the EA Article:</p>

                <a href="originalpcbbottom.jpg"><img src="originalpcbbottomsmall.jpg" alt="" border="0" width="500" height="300"></a>
                <p style="width: 75%">David Fry made a 40th Anniversary thats mostly identical, only the two 2114 RAM chips were changed to 6116 RAM Chips and the 2708 EPROM was changed to a 2716/2732 EPROM, and the whole circuit had been highly compressed onto a double-sided PCB:</p>

                <p style="width: 75%">Because the Original pcb had such a bad resolution I first decided to remake the whole board in Kikad. I wanted to keep the original look of the Computer, first because it looks really unique and second because it is only single-sided and therefore "easy" to etch myself. Here is the Result of that:</p>
