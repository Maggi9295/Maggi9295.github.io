In this Repository you will find all files used by my website.
Its simply programed in plain html, to especially support old systems and all browsers, and to (re)create this "classic" early-90s-internet-look.

I am trying to keep it up to date but please excuse short delays and expect some mistakes in writing. If you find major mistakes or have any questions please feel free to contact me about it.

# Files
In this directory you can find the index.html, projects folder and miscfiles folder.

The index.html provides a list about all my projects and might contain further informations in future.
All the projects are aviable in projects/ and the files of each in their own folder, some might also contain further sub-pages.
The miscfiles folder contains a bunch of unused/previously used images or files, that are to good to be deleted.

All images on this website are shown in a downscaled size to reduce loading times, but are also aviable in full size and can be viewed by clicking on them.
Because of the large file sizes I might reduce the image quality/size in future, to keep the whole repository and website in adorable size.
If thats the case I will update this readme.
