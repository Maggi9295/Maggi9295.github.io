		<h2>Basic Information:</h2>
		<p style="width: 75%">This Computer was a Microcomputer Mevelopment Systems called "SYS-80FT" made by Mostek and manuafactured in 1979. It is the European Version of the <a href="http://deramp.com/mostek.html">AIM-80F</a> sold in America. Apparently both Computers werent very popular, there is a very limited amount of Information about this Computer on the Internet. I found a few catalogs that had Information about the Boards, but also one about the System. Also some small advertisements, but sadly I wasnt able to find a price for how much this System was sold at. Here are a few Pictures:</p>

		<p style="width: 75%">The System I own is equippped with a Monitor, Keyboard, EPROM-Programmer and a bunch of Floppy Disks. The Computer uses Eurocards with two 64-pin Connectors in the back, the bottom one is connected to a backplane which conects to all other cards and the top one is individually wired to the ports in the back or the floppy drives. The following Cards are currently installed:</p>

				microcomputer which acts like a terminal. It uses the<br>
				Fairchild F8 microcontroller(s) (MK3850 & MK3851) and<br>
				communicates with the computer over a external serial<br>
				connecion made to the OEM-80E. It interfaces with a<br>
				normal ASCII keyboard (although I am unsure if the<br>
				DB-25 connector in the back of the computer is a<br>
				standard) and outputs video over RS170.</td>

			<tr>
				<td>Custom V24 Board</td>
				<td>This Card was made by the schoool I found it at. I<br>
				assume this card was made to compensate the lack of<br>
				general purpose serial ports, because the computer<br>
				only offers four unassingned parralel ports. Its not<br>
				installed currently, because I dont have the need<br>
				for additional serial ports and dont know how to<br>
				operate it exactly.</td>

		<p style="width: 75%">The power supply uses plug-in cards as well, although its not possible to exchange its position with another card because of the internal wiring. Also a quick overview:</p>

		<p style="width: 75%">The Computer uses two Shugart SA801 single sided 8 inch floppy disk drives for data storage. The first drive(A / DK0:) oddly is on the right side, while the second(B / DK1:) is on the left.</p>

		<p style="width: 75%">I am very lucky that such a great amount of disks had survived, including Operating Systems and Programs. The System looks for a file called OS.BIN and uses this file to boot the operating system. A few disks are compatible with the CP/M format, while others use a format proprietary to the FLP-80DOS(It might be compatible with the IBM 3740 data entry system format, but I havent been able to check that). The following table shows most of the interesting software, I also wrote down which format it uses and supplied a download link so you can try it yourself.</p>
