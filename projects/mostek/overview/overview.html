		<h2>Basic Information:</h2>
		<p style="width: 75%">This computer was a microcomputer development system called "SYS-80F" made by Mostek and manufactured around 1978-1980. The earliest dates in context to this system (like dates on circuit diagrams) date back to 1977. It is the european version of the <a href="http://deramp.com/mostek.html">AID-80F</a> sold in America. Apparently both computers weren't very popular, there is a very limited amount of information about this computer on the internet. I found a few catalogs that had information about the boards, but also one about the system. Also some small advertisements, but sadly I wasn't able to find a price for how much this system was sold at.  Here are a few pictures found in advertisements:</p>

		<h2>Hardware:</h2>
		<h3>Computer Boards:</h3>
		<p style="width: 75%">The system I own is equippped with a monitor, keyboard, EPROM-programmer and a bunch of floppy disks. The computer uses Eurocards with two 64-pin connectors in the back, the bottom one is connected to a backplane which conects to all other cards and the top one is individually wired to the ports in the back or the floppy drives. The following cards are currently installed:</p>

			<tr>
				<td>OEM-80E</td>
				<td>This is the brain of the computer, its essentially a single-board-computer. It has a bunch of useful functions like a user EPROM socket, a halt indicator and a switch to change the start adress, either from zero or from the EPROMs that handle the monitor and operating system.</td>

			<tr>
				<td>FLP-80E</td>
				<td>This card doesnt look like much, but it is responsible for one of the key functions of the system: the floppy drives. It uses the FD1771 as a floppy controller and everything else is handled by plain logic chips.</td>
				<td>soft sector compatible<br>compatible with IBM 3740 format<br>capable of up to 4 drives<br>capable of double sided drives<br>full sector buffering for data</td>

				<td>VDI-P</td>
				<td>This is a very unique board. It's essentially a whole microcomputer which acts like a terminal. It uses the Fairchild F8 microcontroller(s) (MK3850 & MK3851) and communicates with the computer over a external serial connecion made to the OEM-80E. It interfaces with a normal ASCII keyboard (although I am unsure if the DB-25 connector in the back of the computer is a standard) and outputs video over RS170.</td>

			<tr>
				<td>Custom V24 Board</td>
				<td>This card was made by the schoool I found it at. I assume this card was made to compensate the lack of general purpose serial ports, because the computer only offers four unassingned parralel ports. Its not installed currently, because I dont have the need for additional serial ports and don't know how to operate it exactly.</td>

		<p style="width: 75%">Of course those aren't the only boards available, here is a quick overview of some that I don't own but are mentioned in the databooks. Mostek offered many in-circuit emulators, which can be plugged directly into the target system and then be controlled by the SYS-80F.</p>

				<td>AIM-Z80E</td>
				<td>This pair of boards emulates the behaviour of the Z80 CPU. The small external device is connected between the computer and the target-system. It can be controlled by the SYS-80F and behaves like a real Z80 CPU with a speed of up to 6MHz. This makes it easier to debug Z80 computers.</td>

				<td>Like the name suggests, this also emulates a microprocessor, but instead a 68000. Yes, you've heard right, a MC68000 16-Bit microprocessor. According to the databooks, this board appeared around 1983. It can be executed at a speed of 10MHz and even offers a "Stand-alone" Mode in which it does not require a target-system to execute programs.</td>

		<h3>Power Supply Boards:</h3>
		<p style="width: 75%">The power supply uses plug-in cards as well, although its not possible to exchange its position with another card because of the internal wiring. Also a quick overview:</p>

The transistor is rated up to 15A, but the circuit is most likley not rated for such a high current. The +24V are not accessible on the computer boards, and are only used by the floppy drives.</td>

		<p style="width: 75%">The Computer uses two Shugart SA801 single sided 8 inch floppy disk drives for data storage. The first drive (A / DK0) oddly is on the right side, while the second (B / DK1) is on the left.</p>

		<h2>Software:</h2>
		<p style="width: 75%">I am very lucky that such a great amount of disks had survived, including operating systems and programs. The system looks for a file called OS.BIN and uses this file to boot the operating system. A few disks are compatible with the CP/M format, while others use a format proprietary to the FLP-80DOS(It might be compatible with the IBM 3740 data entry system format, but I havent been able to check that). DeRamp made an <a href="https://deramp.com/downloads/mostek/AID-80F/emulator/">emulator for this computer</a> which allows you to use all floppy disk formats. It does only emulate a terminal connection to the computer, so not all applications might work as expected. The following table shows most of the interesting software, I also wrote down which format it uses and supplied a download link so you can try it yourself.</p>

		<h2>Manuals:</h2>
		<p style="width: 75%">Initially I got the computer without any manuals, but thanks to Peter Ormerod I now own almost all manuals for my Microcomputer System. Some of them were already available in digital form, but some of my manuals not. I really wanted to scan them to make them available for other people and preserve them, but most services are incredibly expencive. Luckily, Mathias Ohlerich reached out to me and kindly offered to scan all missing manuals. Ian Eperson was kind enough to scan his RAM-80BE manual and sent it to me. I am very proud to present to you the (almost) complete list of manuals for the Mostek SYS-80F:</p>
