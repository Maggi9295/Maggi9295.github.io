                <h1>Project: The "General Purpose MicroComputer"</h1>
                <p>I ever wanted to build my own Computer, but I thought I would never be able to do that. After Ive seen the "RC2014" Computer, I realized that its not that Complicated and decided to recreate this Computer. The "Cactus" Computer(using a 6502 CPU and a nice looking Frontpanel) heavily inspired this Computer, especially the Front Panel. Sadly the Computer inst in a working condition right now.</p>
