		<h2>Basic Information:</h2>
		<p style="width: 75%">This Computer was a Microcomputer Mevelopment Systems called "SYS-80FT" made by Mostek and manuafactured in 1979. It is the European Version of the <a href="http://deramp.com/mostek.html">AIM-80F</a> sold in America. Apparently both Computers werent very popular, there is a very limited amount of Information about this Computer on the Internet. I found a few catalogs that had Information about the Boards, but also one about the System. Also some small advertisements, but sadly I wasnt able to find a price for how much this System was sold at. Here are a few Pictures:</p>

		<p style="width: 75%">The System I own is equippped with a Monitor, Keyboard, EPROM-Programmer and a bunch of Floppy Disks. The Computer uses Eurocards with two 64-pin Connectors in the back, the bottom one is connected to a backplane which conects to all other cards and the top one is individually wired to the ports in the back or the floppy drives. The following Cards are currently installed:</p>

				<td>OEM-80E</td>
				<td>This is the brain of the Computer, its essentially a<br>
				single-board-computer. It has a bunch of useful<br>
				functions like a user EPROM socket, a halt indicator<br>
				and a switch to change the the start adress, either<br>
				from zero or from the EPROMs that handle the Monitor<br>
				and Operating System.</td>

				<td>RAM-80BE</td>

				to the System and four additional Parralel Ports.</td>

			<tr>
				<td>FLP-80E</td>
				<td>This card doesnt look like much, but it is<br>
				responsible for one of the key functions of the<br>
				system: the floppy drives. It uses the FD1771 as a<br>
				floppy controller and everything else is handled by<br>
				plain logic chips.</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>VDI-P</td>
				<td>This is a very unique board. Its essentially a whole<br>
				microcomputer which acts like a terminal. It uses the<br>
				Fairchild F8 microcontroller(s) (MK3850 & MK3851) and<br>
				communicates with the computer over a external serial<br>
				connecion made to the OEM-80E. It interfaces with a<br>
				normal ASCII keyboard (although I am unsure if the<br>
				DB-25 connector in the back of the computer is a<br>
				standard) and outputs video over RS170.</td>
				<td>24 lines x 80 char. display<br>5 x 8 dot matrix<br>110-9600 baud serial Interface<br>suports all 128 ASCII characters<br>capable of custom defined characters</td>

			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Custom V24 Board</td>
				<td>This Card was made by the schoool I found it at. I<br>
				assume this card was made to compensate the lack of<br>
				general purpose serial ports, because thecomputer<br>
				only offers four unassingned parralel ports. Its not<br>
				installed currently, because I dont have the need<br>
				for additional serial ports and dont know how to<br>
				operate it exactly.</td>
				<td>two V24 serial Interfaces</td>

		<p style="width: 75%">The power supply uses plug-in cards as well, although its not possible to exchange its position with another card because of the internal wiring. Also a quick overview:</p>

			<tr>
				<td>+5V</td>
				<td>This is most certainly the heart of the Computer, it<br>
				supplys power to almost every part of the Computer. It<br>
				hasa giant heatsink in the back thats beeing heated by<br>
				a MJ11015 200W transistor, a IN6096 diode and a full<br>
				bridge rectifier. Besides of that, it also has a pretty<br>
				extensive regualting circuit.</td>

			<tr>
				<td>±12V</td>
				<td>This is a pretty compact circuit that uses the LM317 and<br>
				LM337 voltage regulators. It also has two LED's in the<br>
				front to indicate that the two 12V lanes are working.<br>
				-12V are used by the computer boards to generate -5V<br>

				<td>This card is really simple, it only has a few components<br>
				and a the 2N3055 used only has a small heatsink. The<br>
				transistor is rated up to 15A, but the circuit is most<br>
				likley not rated for such a high current. The +24V are<br>
				not accessible on the computer boards, and are only<br>
				used by the floppy drives.</td>
