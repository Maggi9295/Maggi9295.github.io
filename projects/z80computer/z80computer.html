		<p style="width: 75%">I ever wanted to build my own Computer, but I thought I would never be able to do that. After Ive seen the "RC2014" Computer, I realized that its not that complicated and decided to recreate this Computer.
		The "<a href="http://commodorez.com/cactus.html">Cactus</a>" Computer(using a 6502 CPU and a nice looking Frontpanel) heavily inspired this Computer, especially the Front Panel. Sadly my Computer inst in a working condition right now, and still heavily work in progress.</p>
		<p style="width: 75%">I decided to use a 19" Subrack and eurocards for it, with a 64-Pin Connector on the back.</p>
